Top question:

- Should we implement both the MicroKernel and Windsor?

Things we just kinda ran across that we want to implement:

- Lifecycles (see http://www.castleproject.org/container/documentation/v1rc3/usersguide/lifecycles.html though docs appear to be wrong about Release calling Dispose)
- Attributes for lifestyles (see http://www.castleproject.org/container/documentation/v1rc3/usersguide/lifestyles.html)
- Pooling - does this use Release() to figure out when it can reuse components?
- Custom lifestyles?
- XML configuration
